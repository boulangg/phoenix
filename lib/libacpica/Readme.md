# ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA)

ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA) is a reference implementation of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification. This implementation simplifies complex ACPI operating system implementations by integrating it directly as a kernel-resident subsystem, without changes to the core ACPICA code.
